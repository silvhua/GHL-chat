I’m perimenopausal, on HRT and I just can’t shift the extra weight that piled on so quickly. I’m not afraid of working hard at things but it’s so disheartening and upsetting when nothing I’m doing seems to be working. Thank you for taking the time to read my message. Kind regards, <name>\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tHey <name>, it\\'s Amanda, creator of the Strong and Sassy Programme. I’m sorry for those computer generated responses but you have me now. 🤗\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tThank you for your honesty ❤️ Can you tell me if all were going according to plan? Where would you like to see yourself in 2024?\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tHi Amanda, in 2024 I’d like to just feel comfortable in my own skin again, to want to socialise instead of looking for excuses to stay home and to just feel a better, happier version of myself. I’ve accepted I won’t fit into the size 10 clothes I was in two years ago but I’d really like to look in the mirror and be proud of myself again xx\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tAh thank you for opening up to me <name>! ❤ I definitely get that! Feeling better, more confident about yourself and your own skin, and becoming the best version of yourself is definitely achievable with the right system in place! Have you tried some methods recently to help you achieve your goals??\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tI tried Bodyslims last year but it just didn’t work for me. I couldn’t find enough spare time in my extremely busy days to listen to seminars, webinars, nightly phone call check ins and the hour long walks. I don’t have a lot of spare time for myself at the moment so I’ve been trying to just focus on the nutrition instead.\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tI totally get it :(  Some programmes are really difficult to sustain! I find that some can be effective for achieving initial results, but in the long-term you need to find a sustainable approach you can maintain for a lifetime. Can you also tell me how important would you say this is to you right now?\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tCompletely agree with you. I have a little girl and it’s so important to me that she doesn’t ever fall into the ‘dieting’ trap. I home cook every evening meal and involve both kids in the cooking process so they learn good habits from a young age. We always look forward to our take away on a Friday though! \\n\\tWe have a family event in May 2024 and I really want to buy something nice and wear it with a huge smile on my face 🥰\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tAh that sounds lovely <name>!! Thanks for sharing!! We can definitely make that happen!! <3 If I were to tell you I have a programme that worked in with your lifestyle as a busy mum to achieve your goal of looking your best for your family event next year, would you follow it?\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tI would love to follow it! ❤️\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tSo number 1 part of my Strong and Sassy programme is nutrition! I don’t just give you calories but educate you on nutrition and help work on your relationship with food and improving nutrition habits!\\n\\t\\n\\t2 - tailored programming to suit your individual goals\\n\\t\\n\\t3 - accountability - I feel very strongly about a lot of communication and it’s why my clients do so well on their journey!\\n\\t\\n\\t4 - part of a community of like-minded women!🥳\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tDoes this sound like a solution to your problem?😉❤️\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tIt sounds fantastic! Would you mind letting me know what the cost is please? Thank you 😊\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tI would be happy to work within your budget. Why don\\'t we make sure I\\'m the best fit first? And then I\\'ll be happy to work within your budget. Fair enough? 🤗\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tThat sounds more than fair Amanda! xx\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tAmazing! 🙌 Are you keen to know more? I\\'d love to schedule a quick call to see if we are a good fit! Will cover everything you need to know about my programme then, including pricing. What\\'s your availability for a quick chat? ❤️\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tI’d love to know more. The only thing is I’m never free to take calls until after 8pm. Would that be ok? xx\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tThat\\'s fine, are you free to chat on Sunday night at 9PM?\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tAbsolutely!\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tFab!

He does most of my initial calls so I get to entirely focus on coaching. 😊\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tNo problem 👍\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tFab! Booking you in!

I maintained for a short while then I had a marriage breakdown. In the last year I have put on 40kilos and I have just lost my job. I am at rock bottom. I need my confidence back and learn once and for all how to manage my weight.\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tAh thanks for sharing <name>! Sorry to hear you had that experience. I suppose learning about self-love and self-care would go a long way in improving your overall health and fitness. Now is the perfect time to take care of yourself as well! 🙏\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tDo you mind if I ask you a few more questions to see if I can help you get back on track?\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tSure thing\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tGreat!

Tell me, why is dropping 40kgs important to you, and how will that impact your life? I\\'d love to help you out the best that I can! ❤️\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tI turned 50 in July and I had a radical abdominoplasty late 2021 that has improved my life drastically. So I have a pretty flat stomach I’m carrying  my excess weight  in my arms legs back and very large breasts. I got scammed $25,000 recently as I bought weight loss products that claimed to lose up to a kilo a day and of course there is no quick fix. I feel gullible and disappointed that I did that as I’ve wiped out my savings now because I felt so desperate\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tI\\'m sorry you had to go through that <name>! That\\'s unfortunate... It\\'s totally understandable that you would feel disappointed and frustrated! 😢 Thank you for opening up to me! I want you to know are not alone there!

I think with the right accountability and support, you can definitely crush it! Would it be helpful if we jumped on a call and mapped out a plan for you about how to get your training and nutrition on track so you can finally lose fat and build confidence, in a way that’s actually achievable and sustainable? ❤\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tThat would be awesome I’m just on a very tight budget as I’ve just lost my job and as I said $25,000 in the garbage. And it’s Christmas so very difficult timing for work for me I’m a full time nanny no one hiring till mid January as family time\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tNo worries <name>! I totally get that. Let me touch base with you in the new year once you\\'re ready!

Where would you like to see yourself in 2024?\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tHi Amanda, in 2024 I’d like to just feel comfortable in my own skin again, to want to socialise instead of looking for excuses to stay home and to just feel a better, happier version of myself. I’ve accepted I won’t fit into the size 10 clothes I was in two years ago but I’d really like to look in the mirror and be proud of myself again xx\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tAh thank you for opening up to me <name>! ❤ I definitely get that! Feeling better, more confident about yourself and your own skin, and becoming the best version of yourself is definitely achievable with the right system in place! Have you tried some methods recently to help you achieve your goals??\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tI tried Bodyslims last year but it just didn’t work for me. I couldn’t find enough spare time in my extremely busy days to listen to seminars, webinars, nightly phone call check ins and the hour long walks. I don’t have a lot of spare time for myself at the moment so I’ve been trying to just focus on the nutrition instead.\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tI totally get it :(  Some programmes are really difficult to sustain! I find that some can be effective for achieving initial results, but in the long-term you need to find a sustainable approach you can maintain for a lifetime. Can you also tell me how important would you say this is to you right now?\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tCompletely agree with you. I have a little girl and it’s so important to me that she doesn’t ever fall into the ‘dieting’ trap. I home cook every evening meal and involve both kids in the cooking process so they learn good habits from a young age. We always look forward to our take away on a Friday though! \\n\\tWe have a family event in May 2024 and I really want to buy something nice and wear it with a huge smile on my face 🥰\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tAh that sounds lovely <name>!!

I maintained for a short while then I had a marriage breakdown. In the last year I have put on 40kilos and I have just lost my job. I am at rock bottom. I need my confidence back and learn once and for all how to manage my weight.\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tAh thanks for sharing <name>! Sorry to hear you had that experience. I suppose learning about self-love and self-care would go a long way in improving your overall health and fitness. Now is the perfect time to take care of yourself as well! 🙏\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tDo you mind if I ask you a few more questions to see if I can help you get back on track?\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tSure thing\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tGreat!

Tell me, why is dropping 40kgs important to you, and how will that impact your life? I\\'d love to help you out the best that I can! ❤️\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tI turned 50 in July and I had a radical abdominoplasty late 2021 that has improved my life drastically. So I have a pretty flat stomach I’m carrying  my excess weight  in my arms legs back and very large breasts. I got scammed $25,000 recently as I bought weight loss products that claimed to lose up to a kilo a day and of course there is no quick fix. I feel gullible and disappointed that I did that as I’ve wiped out my savings now because I felt so desperate\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tI\\'m sorry you had to go through that <name>! That\\'s unfortunate... It\\'s totally understandable that you would feel disappointed and frustrated! 😢 Thank you for opening up to me! I want you to know are not alone there! A lot of my clients used to struggle with losing weight before we worked together!\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tSo what do you feel you need most right now in order to see this happen? ❤\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tI think it’s more about accountability I know pretty much what I need to eat and how much water to drink \\n\\tI know I can’t eat ice cream chocolate and hot chips/wedges I don’t even need to eat that much of them to put on massive amounts of weight.\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tI just want to feel proud of myself and like looking at myself in the mirror\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tSelf loathing and self sabotage have to stop\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tAh I think so too! I think with the right accountability and support, you can definitely crush it! Would it be helpful if we jumped on a call and mapped out a plan for you about how to get your training and nutrition on track so you can finally lose fat and build confidence, in a way that’s actually achievable and sustainable? ❤\\n\\t\\n\\tInboundMessage:\\t\\n\\tThat would be awesome I’m just on a very tight budget as I’ve just lost my job and as I said $25,000 in the garbage. And it’s Christmas so very difficult timing for work for me I’m a full time nanny no one hiring till mid January as family time\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tNo worries <name>! I totally get that. Let me touch base with you in the new year once you\\'re ready! We can definitely arrange something in line with your fitness goals by then 😊\\n\\t\\n\\tOutboundMessage:\\n\\tWould you like to join my free FB group for now?
